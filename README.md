# eLog
Small App that handle an expense log to help you track your expenses. It's built with the following tecnologies:  

- Backend
    - Rust
    - Actix
    - Diesel ORM
    - MariaDB (But could be changed to SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- Frontend
    - VueJS

Currently all work is done in a "monorepo", so this repo contains frontend and backend as well, but in different folders, so you can check them in:

- [Backend](elog_backend/)
- [Frontend](elog_frontend/)
